# 3x-1AlgorythmAverage
This is an algorithm of an algorithm. It takes a range and calculates the amount of times it had to iterate until it reached the number 1 on every single number and calculates the average. It uses the 3x+1 algorithm which always eventually reaches 1.

honestly I'm surprised of how hard it is to upload a python project on Github even while using GitHub Desktop. so fuck it I'll put it in the README file.
